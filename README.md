# ARTICLE_SENTIMENT_ANALYSIS

This project explores the sentiment analysis of multiple online articles using Beautiful Soup for data scraping and Python libraries for analysis.

Project Goals:
Scrape relevant text content from multiple online articles.
Preprocess and clean the extracted text data.
Perform sentiment analysis on the cleaned text to understand the overall sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of each article.
Technologies Used:
Beautiful Soup: For web scraping and extracting text content from HTML pages.
NLTK: For natural language processing tasks like tokenization, stop word removal, and stemming/lemmatization.
VADER: A lexicon-based sentiment analysis tool by Valued Emotions Analysis Dictionary.
Pandas: For data manipulation and storage.
Project Steps:
Data Scraping:
Define article URLs or a search query to scrape relevant articles.
Use Beautiful Soup to parse the HTML content of each website.
Extract the main text content of each article (e.g., article body, excluding irrelevant sections like menus or ads).
Data Preprocessing:
Convert text to lowercase.
Remove punctuation and special characters.
Tokenize the text into individual words.
Remove stop words (common words with little semantic meaning).
Apply stemming or lemmatization to normalize words (e.g., "walking", "walked", and "walks" become "walk").
Sentiment Analysis:
Use VADER or another sentiment analysis library to assess the sentiment of each text segment (sentence or article).
Calculate the overall sentiment score for each article based on the individual sentence scores.
Results and Analysis:
Visualize the distribution of sentiment scores across all articles.
Analyze the correlation between specific keywords or topics and sentiment scores.
Identify significant trends or patterns in the sentiment analysis results.
Additional Notes:
This project can be extended to include feature engineering and machine learning models for more advanced sentiment analysis.
Consider incorporating other libraries for visualization like Matplotlib or Seaborn to present the results in a clear and informative way.
Ensure ethical considerations during web scraping, respecting robots.txt guidelines and avoiding overloading websites.
